This repository contains all the files and links to implement this project. 

There is a link of config file. It is already modified for single class weapon detection. It can be used to re-produce the weight file. Or, one can use the fully trained weight file on weapon detection and detection script to detect weapons. 

To do this, one need to download the python script file for detection. Get the dataset, the name and data file from the link. To implement, one also need the train.txt file. After gathering all this files, one needs to install the dependencies of the python script. After that provide all the file path to appropriate location in script. One need a sample image or video to detect in image or video. This model also supports the command line options.
